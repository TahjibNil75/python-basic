- Software should be open for extension. But closed for Modification

- `Open for extension` → We should be able to add new functionality without touching existing code.

- `Closed for modification` → Existing, tested, stable code shouldn’t need changes when adding new features.

- Dont Modify Old code, Extend it through Inheritance or composition
